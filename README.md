# Example: robotframework + Selenium2Library + RIDE

This repository provides a simple test suite that
checks the login and logout capabilities of the
python.org website using robotframework together
with Selenium2Library and the RIDE editor.

The [Main test file](./example_testsuite.txt) can be executed directly:

```
pybot example_testsuite.txt
```

or imported as a testsuite within the
[RIDE](https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/wiki) editor.

Additional
[keywords and variables](./example_testsuite_resource_file.txt) have
been defined to improve both the readability and maintainability of
these tests.
